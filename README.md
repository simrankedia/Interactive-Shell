Interactive-Shell
=================

User-friendly linux terminal

The code shell_final.c is a user defined interactive shell program that can create and manage new processes. The shell is able to create a process out of a system program like emacs, vi or any user-defined executable

It works similar to the terminal and all terminal commands can be executed on it. 

It is a basic version of the actual shell and doesnot respond to tab in automatic completion of file/directory name.
